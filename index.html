            <h2>Tor-Powered Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden Services</h2>
            <p>
               This is the homepage of the Onion Name System (OnioNS), a naming service for Tor that allows hidden services to be accessed by meaningful domain names. OnioNS provides a secure solution to a major usability issue that has been with Tor since its introduction in 2004. To date, no other work in academic literature nor in practice has been appropriate or practical enough to be used as an alternative DNS for Tor hidden services. OnioNS is therefore an original solution and was specifically designed for Tor's privacy-enhanced environment.
            </p>
            <p>
               OnioNS is currently under development and is not yet ready for widespread use. Download instructions will be placed here when the OnioNS is ready for public testing. In the meantime, the development home is on Github: <a href="https://github.com/Jesse-V/OnioNS">Jesse-V/OnioNS</a>; feel free to star it. While we of course welcome contributions and alpha testing, please bear in mind that the code is incomplete and has a tendency to segfault if it decides that it just doesn't like you. It's currently temperamental like that.
            </p>
